I would add several more checkpoints. First of all, in menu, we have to check if it is a good word products or services, depending on the type of business a company has. Also, if a user mentioned or if AI found in Google Business Profile products or services, these should be added on the website as separate pages in service template pages. And these pages should be added in the main menu under products/services tab. Then, we have a phone number that should be also checked in Google Business Profile, in case it is not provided in profile or if profile doesn't exist, we can remove this element from the website. Next, if it is a business that sells products, we should give better CTA for buttons on the website, schedule now is good only if there are some kind of meetings, appointments, visits, exams, etc. Next, in the part that is named services section on the homepage, as I explained for pages, service/ products pages, these service or products should exist in this section below hero section on homepage. It is preferred to fetch images from Google Business Profile (products section) or to use images a client provided. If nothing else is available, then images from Unsplash or Pexels can be imported. Features related to location should be modified. It is very important that AI understands business of the user, so it can provide something that makes sense and that is not fluff. What our clients say should be definitely imported from Google Business Profile. If there is not Google Business Profile, this section should not appear. For meet our team, I said that it should be optional only in case user provided information, then it can be displayed. Map should be set up according to address that a user chose in the process of filling a questionnaire on homepage. Footer should be also customized according to information from Google Business Profile. If there are not enough of them (address, phone number), it should be left with place holders Address, Phone number. Speaking about social media links, only icons of social media that a user mentioned in their questionnaire should appear in the footer.
