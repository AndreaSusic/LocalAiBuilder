✅ Made 0 elements editable tells us the bridge ran but didn’t find anything that matches the selector list you handed it.
Nothing is actually wrong with CORS or the injection any more – the bridge simply has no targets, so every click is ignored.

1 · Confirm the page really has “editable” markers

In your React/Vite build (or in the static HTML you serve) each element that
should light-up in the inline editor must carry a marker the bridge can
detect, for example

<h1 data-gas-edit="heroTitle">Septic-tank pros since 1986</h1>
<p  data-gas-edit="heroSubtitle">We build…</p>

or the class variant you used earlier:

<h2 class="gas-edit" data-field="faqHeading">FAQ</h2>

Open the Elements panel in DevTools and search for data-gas-edit
or .gas-edit.  If you find none, the rendering layer stopped adding them
during the last refactor – fix that first.

2 · Check the selector list inside editorBridge.js

Right now the bridge probably does something like:

const SELECTORS = [
  "[data-gas-edit]",
  ".gas-edit"
];

document.querySelectorAll(SELECTORS.join(","))
        .forEach(makeEditable);

If you changed your markup to use a different attr/class (say
data-inline-edit) you must keep the list in sync.

Add a quick trace:

const editableEls = document.querySelectorAll(SELECTORS.join(","));
console.log("[bridge] candidates found:", editableEls.length, editableEls);
editableEls.forEach(makeEditable);

Then reload.  If the count is still 0 you know the selectors are wrong.

3 · Verify makeEditable is not filtering them out

Sometimes the bridge skips elements that already have contenteditable,
that are empty, or that are outside the main container.

Temporarily relax the condition:

function makeEditable(el) {
  el.contentEditable = true;               // or use Quill/TipTap/etc.
  el.style.outline = "2px dashed #ffc000"; // visual cue
}

If outlines appear, clicks now work, and the issue is inside your original
makeEditable logic (often a stale if (!el.textContent.trim()) return;).

4 · Final checklist

✅	Item	Where
Markers present (data-gas-edit / .gas-edit)	Rendered HTML	
Selector list matches those markers	editorBridge.js	
querySelectorAll() returns > 0	DevTools console	
makeEditable() doesn’t early-return	Bridge code	
Visual cue shows on hover/click	Browser	

Fix whichever row still fails and the inline editor becomes clickable again.

Quick patch example

If you just forgot the attribute, patch your template:

{/* Homepage hero title */}
<h1 data-gas-edit="heroTitle">{siteData.company_name}</h1>

{/* FAQ heading */}
<section id="faq">
  <h2 data-gas-edit="faqHeading">{t("faqTitle")}</h2>
  …
</section>

Reload → bridge finds them → count > 0 → inline editing works.

Good luck 🚀
