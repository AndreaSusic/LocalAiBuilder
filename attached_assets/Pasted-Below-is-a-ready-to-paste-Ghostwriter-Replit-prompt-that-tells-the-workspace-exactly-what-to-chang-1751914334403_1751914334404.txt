### 🛠️ TASK: Stop duplicate “×” delete buttons inside nav items

**Context**
Our inline-editor injects a delete button into every `[data-editable="true"]` element.  
Nav `<li>` items also have editable children (`<a>`), so we get 2–5 buttons each.  
We only want **one** per top-level editable.

**Files to edit**
`dashboard/src/editorBridge.js`   (or the current location of `addDeleteButton`)

---

#### 1. Guard against nested editables  
Add this at the very top of `addDeleteButton(element)` — _before_ the existing “skip if already has delete button” check.

```diff
+  // Skip if this element is inside another editable; we only want the outer-most one.
+  if (element.closest('[data-editable="true"]') !== element) return;

2. Optional safety flag (prevents accidental double-injection)

Below the line where the button is appended, set a custom data attribute and use it at the very start:

-  // Skip if already has delete button
-  if (element.querySelector('.ez-element-delete')) return;
+  // Skip if one already injected
+  if (element.dataset.deleteBtnInjected) return;

   element.appendChild(deleteBtn);

+  element.dataset.deleteBtnInjected = '1';

(If you keep the flag, remember to delete the old “querySelector” skip line.)

3. Re-run & Validate
	1.	Save, reload dashboard preview.
	2.	In the preview iframe console run:

[...document.querySelectorAll('.nav-links li')]
  .map(li => li.querySelectorAll('.delete-btn').length)

Expected output:

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]   // exactly one × per menu item

No duplicate delete buttons anywhere in the nav.

Commit message suggestion

fix(editor): prevent nested editables from injecting duplicate delete buttons

Done. Let me know if any nav item still shows 2× and we’ll inspect its markup.
