Why nothing is selectable

Your bridge did run but it found ‚Äú0 elements‚Äù that match its selector, so it sets zero contenteditables and logs:

üîß Initializing inline editor bridge...
‚úÖ Made 0 elements editable

‚Äì that‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôre seeing.

‚∏ª

‚ù∂ Confirm what the bridge is looking for

Open the injected script (or the part you add with innerHTML = ‚Ä¶).
You‚Äôll see something like:

const EDITABLE_SELECTOR = '[data-editable]';   // or '.editable', '.js-edit', etc.

document.querySelectorAll(EDITABLE_SELECTOR).forEach(el => {
  el.contentEditable = 'true';
  // other hookups: onBlur ‚Üí POST /save, etc.
});

If the selector is '[data-edit]', but your HTML has data-editable or nothing at all, the bridge won‚Äôt find anything ‚Üí 0 elements.

‚∏ª

‚ù∑ Mark the actual text nodes you want to edit

Edit the rendered HTML template so the elements you want to click carry the attribute / class expected by the bridge, e.g.:

<h1 data-editable="heroHeading">AI-powered website builder</h1>

<p data-editable="heroSub">
  Start generating a professional website in seconds ‚Äì no code needed.
</p>

<button class="btn-primary" data-editable="ctaText">
  Start Building
</button>

If your bridge is using a class:

<h2 class="editable" data-key="feature1Title">Lightning-fast AI</h2>


‚∏ª

‚ù∏ Reload preview and test
	1.	Refresh the /preview page.
	2.	Check the console ‚Äì you should now see something like
‚úÖ Made 3 elements editable.
	3.	Click the H1 or paragraph ‚Äì the caret will appear.

‚∏ª

‚ùπ (Optionally) expose keys for saving

If you want the bridge to know what it‚Äôs updating, keep an ID/key:

<p data-editable data-key="heroSub">
  ...
</p>

Your bridge can then POST:

fetch('/api/save', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    key: el.dataset.key,
    value: el.innerHTML
  })
});

Quick debugging checklist

Check	How
Bridge injected once?	You already see the ‚Äúinline script injected‚Äù log ‚úÖ
Correct selector?	console.log(EDITABLE_SELECTOR) inside the bridge
Elements match?	In DevTools Console: document.querySelectorAll('[data-editable]') ‚Üí should show NodeList( n ).
CSS pointer-events?	Make sure no overlay div is blocking clicks. Use Elements panel ‚Üí ‚ÄúForce element state :hover‚Äù to see.
Iframe sandboxing?	If preview is in an iframe with sandbox attribute, add allow-same-origin allow-scripts so contentEditable works.


‚∏ª

What to do next
	1.	Add the expected attribute/class to every piece of text you want editable.
	2.	Reload ‚Äì bridge will now find them.
	3.	Optional: extend the bridge to auto-attach the attribute when rendering (e.g. inside your React components) so you don‚Äôt have to add them manually each time.

If you paste a snippet of your current bridge selector or want a tiny utility that auto-wraps all <h1-h6>,p,span in edit wrappers, let me know and I‚Äôll drop it in!
