Because document.querySelectorAll('[data-edit]') returned 0, we now know that:
	‚Ä¢	React did mount the template root (we saw all the ‚ÄúHomepageV1 using data ‚Ä¶‚Äù logs), but none of the nodes that should carry data-edit attributes ever reached the DOM.
	‚Ä¢	That means some component in the render tree is throwing (or exiting early) before JSX with <Editable ‚Ä¶> tags is returned.

Below is a quick way to locate the breaker and get the elements back into the page.

‚∏ª

1  Catch the exact exception

Add an ad-hoc error boundary around the whole template.
(You only need this temporarily to see the stack trace.)

// dashboard/src/components/TemplatePreview.jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import HomepageV1 from '../templates/homepage/v1';
import SiteDataProvider from '../context/SiteDataProvider';

class TemplateErrorBoundary extends Component {
  state = { err: null };
  static getDerivedStateFromError(err) { return { err }; }
  componentDidCatch(err, info) { console.error('üí• Template crash:', err, info); }
  render() {
    if (this.state.err)
      return <pre style={{color:'red'}}>{String(this.state.err)}</pre>;
    return this.props.children;
  }
}

export default function TemplatePreview({ templateData }) {
  return (
    <SiteDataProvider bootstrap={templateData}>
      <TemplateErrorBoundary>
        <HomepageV1 bootstrap={templateData}/>
      </TemplateErrorBoundary>
    </SiteDataProvider>
  );
}

Reload /preview and keep the iframe console open.
You‚Äôll either see a red <pre> with the error text in the iframe itself or a red stack-trace in the console starting with ‚Äúüí• Template crash:‚Äù.
That tells you which section or helper blew up.

2  Typical culprits (check these first)

Suspect	Symptom	Fix
Undefined data access (e.g. services[0] when services is '')	Error like Cannot read properties of undefined	Guard with Array.isArray(services) && services[0] or default []
Circular import still lurking	Error like undefined is not a function at first line of a section file	Make sure every file only imports SiteDataContext, never imports the provider component back.
Early return null in a section	No error, but section absent in React-DevTools tree	Replace with a meaningful fallback (e.g. render placeholder text) so that <Editable> tags still appear.


‚∏ª

3  Verify in React-DevTools
	1.	In DevTools, switch to the iframe frame (Sources ‚ñ∏ Paused ‚ñ∏ top-left dropdown).
	2.	Open the React panel ‚ñ∏ Components tab.
	3.	You should see something like:

TemplateErrorBoundary
  HomepageV1
    HeroSection
      Editable
    ServicesSection
      Editable
    ‚Ä¶

Anything that is missing or greyed out is the component that aborted.

‚∏ª

4  After you fix the thrower ‚Ä¶

Reload, run again:

document.querySelectorAll('[data-edit]').length   // üëâ should be > 0

The inline-editor bridge will now report something like:

üè∑Ô∏è Setting up comprehensive editable elements...
Found 9 elements with data-edit attributes
‚úÖ Made 9 elements editable with delete buttons

‚Ä¶and the dashed outlines / toolbar will work.

‚∏ª

TL;DR
	‚Ä¢	Wrap the template in an error boundary to surface the real runtime error.
	‚Ä¢	Fix that (likely undefined data or residual circular import).
	‚Ä¢	Confirm [data-edit] nodes now exist ‚Üí the editor bridge will pick them up automatically.

Ping me with the first error message you see and I‚Äôll narrow the patch further if needed.
