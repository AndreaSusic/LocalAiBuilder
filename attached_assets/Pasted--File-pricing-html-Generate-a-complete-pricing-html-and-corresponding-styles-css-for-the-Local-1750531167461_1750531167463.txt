# File: pricing.html
Generate a complete `pricing.html` and corresponding `styles.css` for the LocalAI Builder site, using plain HTML5 and vanilla CSS. Follow these requirements:

1. **Structure & Content**  
   - Use the existing site header/navigation (logo + links: Home, Pricing, Industries, FAQ, Login).  
   - Page title: `<h1>` “Pricing Plans” (with `data-lang="pricingTitle"` and Serbian comment).  
   - A 4-column responsive grid of plan cards: **Free**, **Starter ($29/mo)**, **Pro ($50/mo)**, **Agency ($99/mo)**.  
   - Each card must include:  
     - Plan name & price  
     - Short tagline (e.g. “Try it free forever” / “Great for small teams” / “For growing agencies” / “Unlimited sites & seats”)  
     - Feature list:  
       - Sites included  
       - Custom domain support  
       - HTTPS hosting  
       - Prompt-generated sites  
       - Membership/Login areas  
       - 24/7 AI Chat Support  
       - Industry SEO pages (Free: view only)  
       - Stripe & PayPal checkout (Free: ❌)  
       - White-label export (Pro+: ✔)  
       - Team seats  
       - Annual billing discount (Starter & Pro: 10%, Agency: 15%)  
     - A “Select Plan” button linking to `/cart.html?plan=PLAN_KEY` (`PLAN_KEY` = free|starter|pro|agency).  

2. **Responsive CSS** (`styles.css`)  
   - Mobile-first: single‐column cards on ≤ 640px, 2 columns on 641–1023px, 4 columns ≥ 1024px.  
   - Use CSS variables:  
     ```css
     :root {
       --primary: #2e8b57;
       --accent: #f4b400;
       --dark: #222;
       --light: #f9fafb;
     }
     ```  
   - Cards: white background, subtle border, box-shadow, padding, border‐radius.  
   - Buttons: background `var(--primary)`, white text, padding, border‐radius.  
   - Typography: system-ui font, use relative units (`rem`, `clamp`).  

3. **Accessibility & i18n**  
   - All user strings in elements must have `data-lang` attributes (default “en”), with Serbian versions in HTML comments.  
   - Buttons and links should have `aria-label` where appropriate.  

4. **Footer**  
   - Include the site footer: © 2025 LocalAI Builder • ToS • Privacy • Contact  

5. **Links & Placeholders**  
   - ToS `/tos.html`, Privacy `/privacy.html`, Contact `mailto:contact@localai-builder.com`.  
   - Make the “Select Plan” buttons `<a>` tags that point to the cart URL.  

Generate the files in a single code block or as separate files: `pricing.html` and `styles.css`. Ensure the markup and styling are ready to drop into your project.
