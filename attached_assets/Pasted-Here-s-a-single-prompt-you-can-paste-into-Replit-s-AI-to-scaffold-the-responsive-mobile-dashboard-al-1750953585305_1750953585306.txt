Here’s a single prompt you can paste into Replit’s AI to scaffold the responsive mobile dashboard alongside your existing desktop version:

You have an existing React/Vite Dashboard component that renders a three-column desktop layout for screens ≥800px. Now add a mobile-only version for <800px without touching the desktop code:

1. Create two new React components under `src/components/`:  
   • `DesktopDashboard.jsx` – copy and paste your current desktop Dashboard UI here.  
   • `MobileDashboard.jsx` – implement the mobile HTML/CSS wireframe with:  
     – Sticky top bar (hamburger, 🔔, Publish, View Preview)  
     – Versions panel  
     – Tabbed Chat / Editor panel  

2. In `src/App.jsx` (or your route component), wrap these in a single `ResponsiveDashboard` component that does:  
   ```jsx
   import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
   import DesktopDashboard from './components/DesktopDashboard';
   import MobileDashboard from './components/MobileDashboard';

   export default function ResponsiveDashboard() {
     const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = useState(window.innerWidth < 800);
     useEffect(() => {
       const onResize = () => setIsMobile(window.innerWidth < 800);
       window.addEventListener('resize', onResize);
       return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', onResize);
     }, []);
     return isMobile ? <MobileDashboard /> : <DesktopDashboard />;
   }

	3.	Ensure your global CSS (or Tailwind config) has the same panel, button, border‐radius and color styles (#d3d3d3 background, #2a2a2a borders, white panels, 10px radius).
	4.	Wire up the “Publish” and “View Preview” handlers in MobileDashboard.jsx the same way they work on desktop.
	5.	Test by resizing the browser:
– ≥800px shows your existing desktop layout unchanged.
– <800px shows the new mobile layout.

Generate all files, import paths and basic styling. Don’t delete any desktop code—just layer the new mobile component behind this responsive switch.

Just paste that into Replit’s AI chat and it will generate the two components plus the responsive wrapper for you.
