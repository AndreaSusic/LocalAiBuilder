What the console still tells us

⚠️ TemplatePreview useEffect: ALL EDITOR INJECTION DISABLED
✅ Only WorkingInlineEditor.jsx component should handle editing

That exact message is printed from compiled code that is still included in the bundle, so we know:
	1.	The TemplatePreview that the browser receives still contains the old “kill-switch” useEffect.
	2.	The new useEffect that should import('../components/WorkingInlineEditor') never executes.
	3.	Therefore no delete buttons or editable zones appear.

⸻

Prompt for Replit to wipe the kill-switch everywhere and mount the editor

NOTE: the project seems to contain multiple copies or historical versions of TemplatePreview. We have to update every file that prints the kill-switch message, otherwise the wrong copy keeps being compiled.

🔧 **TASK: completely remove the "ALL EDITOR INJECTION DISABLED" kill-switch
and mount WorkingInlineEditor**

1️⃣  **Search the whole repo** for the string  
    `ALL EDITOR INJECTION DISABLED`  
    (examples: `grep -R "ALL EDITOR INJECTION DISABLED" dashboard/src`).

2️⃣  For **every** file that contains that text
    (likely TemplatePreview.jsx, TemplatePreview.tsx or similar):
    • Delete the entire `useEffect` (or any early-return) that prints the message.  
    • Make sure there is **no `return null` or `return` before the component’s JSX**.

3️⃣  At the end of the same component (just before `export default`),
    add **one** clean `useEffect` that mounts the editor **once**:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';

useEffect(() => {
  if (window.__editorMounted) return;      // guard
  window.__editorMounted = true;

  import('../components/WorkingInlineEditor').then(({ default: mount }) => {
    // When this TemplatePreview is rendered inside the iframe, `document`
    // refers to the iframe document, which is what we want.
    mount(document);
    console.log('🟢 WorkingInlineEditor mounted');
  });
}, []);

4️⃣  Confirm that WorkingInlineEditor.jsx (or .ts) exports a default function
like export default function mount(doc) { … }.
It must:
- add .delete-btn-outer to <li> elements;
- add .delete-btn-inner to elements inside an <li>;
- append CSS that hides .delete-btn-inner.

5️⃣  Remove any other legacy editor injections
(e.g. ComprehensiveInlineEditor, autoSaveEditor, etc.).
They should not run at all.

6️⃣  Re-run / rebuild the dashboard.
✅ In DevTools inside the iframe you should now see:
• 🟢 WorkingInlineEditor mounted
• log lines such as 🎯 Adding OUTER delete button to LI
• No more ALL EDITOR INJECTION DISABLED message.

7️⃣  Verify visually:
• Each menu <li> now shows one red “×” when hovered.
• Inner anchor <a> no longer shows its own “×”.
• Other content blocks still have one delete button and remain editable.

If any copy of the kill-switch message still appears, repeat step 1 – there is still another old TemplatePreview file being compiled.

Run the prompt above in Replit chat; after the rebuild, reload `/preview` with a hard refresh (⇧ + ⌘/Ctrl + R).  
Let me know **which** of the expected console lines is missing if the buttons are still not back.
