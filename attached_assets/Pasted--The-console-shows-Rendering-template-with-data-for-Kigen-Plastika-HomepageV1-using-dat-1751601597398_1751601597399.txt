 The console shows:

✅ "🎨 Rendering template with data for: Kigen Plastika"
✅ "HomepageV1 using data: {city: Array(1), images: Array(10), social: {…}, colours: Array(2), industry: 'Septic Tanks', …}"
But I don't see:

"🏠 HomepageV1 rendering with data:"
"🔥 About to render HeroSection"
"🎯 HeroSection is rendering!"
This means HomepageV1 is loading data but not executing the render function properly. There's likely a JavaScript error preventing the template from rendering. Let me check if there's a routing issue by examining how the preview is being loaded:

Opened dashboard/src/App.jsx
Now let me check the routing to see which route is being used for the preview:

Opened dashboard/src/App.jsx
I can see the issue! The App.jsx routes to TemplatePreview for short URLs (/t/v1/:id), not directly to HomepageV1. Let me check the TemplatePreview component to see if it's properly rendering the HomepageV1 template:

Opened dashboard/src/components/TemplatePreview.jsx
Let me check the rest of the TemplatePreview component to see how it renders the HomepageV1:

Opened dashboard/src/components/TemplatePreview.jsx
Perfect! Now I can see the flow:

✅ TemplatePreview loads data successfully ("🔍 Fetching preview data for ID:")
✅ TemplatePreview renders HomepageV1 ("🎨 Rendering template with data for: Kigen Plastika")
✅ HomepageV1 receives data ("HomepageV1 using data: {city: Array(1), images: Array(10), ...}")
❌ HomepageV1 render function never executes (missing "🏠 HomepageV1 rendering with data:")
The issue is that the HomepageV1 template is receiving data but not rendering. This suggests there's a JavaScript error in the HomepageV1 component. Let me add error handling to catch what's breaking:
Let me check the exact structure around the function definition:

Opened dashboard/src/templates/homepage/v1/index.jsx
Let me find the function definition:

Opened dashboard/src/templates/homepage/v1/index.jsx
Now I can add debugging to the function start:

Edited dashboard/src/templates/homepage/v1/index.jsx
Now let me wrap the rest of the function in a try-catch block to identify any JavaScript errors:

Opened dashboard/src/templates/homepage/v1/index.jsx
Let me find the end of the function to add error handling:

Searched for "Find the end of HomepageV1 function to add catch block"
I can see from the search results that the function is missing a closing brace and error handling. Let me add proper error handling to identify what's causing the rendering to stop:

Opened dashboard/src/templates/homepage/v1/index.jsx
The function looks complete structurally. Let me add a catch block to wrap the entire function and identify any JavaScript errors:

Edited dashboard/src/templates/homepage/v1/index.jsx
I see the LSP error - the try block is malformed. Let me fix the syntax:

Edited dashboard/src/templates/homepage/v1/index.jsx
Now let me test the error handling to see what's breaking the HomepageV1 component:

✅ Added comprehensive error handling to HomepageV1 component
✅ Fixed try-catch syntax to catch any JavaScript errors
✅ Added detailed debugging logs throughout the render process

Check the console for this diagnostic sequence:

"🚀 HomepageV1 function started, bootstrap:" (confirms function execution)
"🏠 HomepageV1 rendering with data:" (confirms render section)
Either successful render or "🔥 HomepageV1 render error:" with specific error details
What do you see in the console? Any error messages or missing logs will pinpoint the exact issue.
