◾ TASK  (stability pass)
  1. Raise overlay-button z-index so they never sit under the <nav>.
  2. Guarantee delete / replace buttons are re-attached after ANY
     undo / redo, for BOTH images and text elements.
  3. Make the text-element ✕ always work, even after an image
     delete-undo cycle.

◾ ROOT CAUSES
  • delete-btn / replace-btn currently have z-index 1 000; nav has z-index 1.
    In some browsers nav still wins – set 10 000.
  • Undo restores raw HTML, wiping JS listeners and buttons.
    The fallback wiring runs only for the “selected” element,
    so other nodes stay unwired.
  • The click handler that builds ✕ is attached once; after we
    remove and re-insert a node it disappears.

◾ IMPLEMENT   (public/frozen-ui-v1/frozen-ui.js)
  1️⃣  FUNCTION wireInlineEditor(root=document)
      – already exists; ensure it:
        a. iterates over ALL editable selectors
           'h1,h2,h3,h4,p,nav,.contact-phone,.cta,.btn-primary,.btn-accent,
            footer,.nav-links li a,.logo,img,.img-placeholder'
        b. if (el.dataset.wired) return; else el.dataset.wired = '1';
        c. attaches mouseenter / mouseleave / click and,
           for images / placeholders, calls createImageOverlayButtons(el).
  2️⃣  call wireInlineEditor(document) in THREE places:
        • DOMContentLoaded
        • at the very end of undo()  (after innerHTML replacement)
        • at the very end of redo()
  3️⃣  undo()/redo()
        – after restoring HTML, optionally re-select previous element
          and add class 'selected' so overlay attaches.
        – then wireInlineEditor(document);   // rewires everything
  4️⃣  Export createImageOverlayButtons globally (e.g., attach to window)
        so undo()/redo() can call it without “not defined” errors.
  5️⃣  In delete-btn.onclick for TEXT nodes
        – after el.remove()   pushState();
          (this solves the “first action only” bug)
  6️⃣  Global MutationObserver already exists → keep but change callback to
        wireInlineEditor(mutation.addedNodes[i])  when nodeType === 1.

◾ STYLE  (public/frozen-ui-v1/index.html  <style>)
      .delete-btn, .replace-btn { z-index: 10000 !important; }

◾ DONE WHEN
  • Reload page → hover any text → red outline + ✕ visible.
  • Hover nav, phone, hero buttons → ✕ never hides behind nav.
  • Hover image → red outline + ✕ + 🖼️.
  • Delete image → dashed placeholder.
  • Undo ↶ → image returns **with working ✕ + 🖼️**.
  • Delete text after image undo works every time.
  • Repeat delete/undo/redo 10× with no console errors.
