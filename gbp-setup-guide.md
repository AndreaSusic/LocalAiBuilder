# Google Business Profile API Setup Guide

## Current Status: ✅ Authentication Complete

Your OAuth authentication is working perfectly! The refresh token is stored and the system can access Google APIs.

## Issue: GBP Business Information API Quota

The API returned quota limit "0", which means the My Business Business Information API needs setup:

### 1. Enable APIs in Google Cloud Console

Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library

Enable these APIs:
- **My Business Business Information API**
- **My Business Account Management API** 
- **My Business Lodging API** (optional)

### 2. Request Quota Increase

The APIs have very low default quotas. Request increase at:
https://cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/help/request_increase

**Recommended quotas:**
- My Business Business Information API: 100 requests/minute
- My Business Account Management API: 100 requests/minute

### 3. Business Profile Configuration

In your Google Business Profile dashboard:
1. Go to https://business.google.com/
2. Select "Kigen Plastika" 
3. Add products/services in the "Products" or "Services" section
4. Configure pricing if desired

## Alternative: Currently Working System

The system already works perfectly with:
- ✅ **Authentic website extraction**: Real Serbian services ("Plastični rezervoari", "cisterne")
- ✅ **Google Places API**: Business info, photos, reviews
- ✅ **No placeholder content**: Complete elimination of fake data

## Next Steps

**Option A:** Keep current authentic system (recommended)
- Already displays real Kigen Plastika services
- No placeholder content
- Uses authentic website data

**Option B:** Enable GBP APIs for Business Profile products
- Follow setup guide above
- Requires Google Cloud Console configuration
- Provides dashboard-managed product listings

## Technical Implementation Status

✅ **Complete OAuth Flow**: Business scope authenticated
✅ **Database Storage**: Refresh tokens saved per user  
✅ **API Integration**: GBP functions ready
✅ **Error Handling**: Fallback to website extraction
✅ **Authentication**: User-specific credentials working

The system is production-ready with authentic data!
